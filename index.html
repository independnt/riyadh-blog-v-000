      <p>Once a mudbrick waystation along desert trading routes, Riyadh is now one of the wealthiest cities in the world.
      The country's political, financial and administrative capital is also a city with a fascinating subtext.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Riydah is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. It is also the capital of Riydah Province. I have no idea what any of that means,
      but it seems like a wonderful place. I mean look at all those guys climbing those escalators. Those are some fancy ass stairs. Think that's impressive?
    You haven't seen anything yet.</p>

    <p>The city is divided into 15 districts. That's right, 15. "Why are there so many districts?", you might ask. Well, ever since the camels invaded in 2010,
    the city has expanded to make room for the camel overlords. Here you can see a group of camel riding in a pickup truck.</p>
