      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>Once a mudbrick waystation along desert trading routes, Riyadh is now one of the wealthiest cities in the world.
      The country's political, financial and administrative capital is also a city with a fascinating subtext.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Riydah is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. It is also the capital of Riydah Province. I have no idea what any of that means,
      but it seems like a wonderful place. I mean look at all those guys climbing those escalators. Those are some fancy ass stairs. Think that's impressive?
